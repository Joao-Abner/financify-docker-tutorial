Introduction
------------

Financify-Docker-CRUD is a PHP-based web application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a MySQL database, all packaged within a Docker container environment. This project is an example implementation of a simple financial management system, inspired by the Udarax.me tutorial.

The main objective of this application is to provide a practical example of how to build a web application with a PHP backend, MySQL database, and containerize the entire stack using Docker. This project can serve as a starting point for developers who want to learn about building and deploying web applications with PHP, MySQL, and Docker.

Key features of the Financify-Docker-CRUD application include:
- CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete financial records stored in a MySQL database.
- Docker Containerization: The entire application stack, including PHP and MySQL, is packaged and deployed using Docker containers.

By exploring the Financify-Docker-CRUD project, developers can learn about the following concepts and technologies:
PHP Programming: Understand the fundamentals of PHP and how to build a web application with it.

MySQL Database Integration: Learn how to integrate a MySQL database with a PHP application and perform CRUD operations.
Docker Containerization: Explore the benefits of containerizing a web application and its components using Docker.

This project is designed to be a learning resource for developers who want to enhance their skills in web application development, database integration, and containerization using Docker.
